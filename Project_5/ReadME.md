## Project 5: Finish your portfolio website

To **make it market ready** and to show to your potential employers with what **you have learnt so far!**

Some things to consider:
* Get a domain
* get a hosting
* make your website dynamic

**(Important note from participant: I've embedded CSS and javascript using "style" tags and "script" tags code into a single HTML page, I didn't keep seperate files for them)**
