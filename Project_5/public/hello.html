    <div class="animated slideInRight">
    <p class="heading">Live Sass compiler:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This VS Code extension is used for compiling SCSS files to CSS files quickly compared to the other compilers like Visual Studio extensions. This is handy for web developers while developing webpages with SCSS files.</p>
    <p class="heading">Debugger for Chrome:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for debugging JavaScript code in the Google Chrome browser for webpages in the Visual Studio Code environment. This extension is a lot more convenient than the Chrome console for debugging JavaScript code. To work with this, first install the extension and then set up the lauch.json settings for debugging the particular webpage you want to investigate. </p>
    <p class="heading">C#:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for developing web applications in C# in the Visual Studio Code editor. By using this extension, you can use C# code development and access features like Go to Definition, Find All Reference, IntelliSense etc., which were normally available in source editors like Visual Studio. </p>
    <p class="heading">Live Server:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for launching a development local server with a live reload feature for static and dynamic pages. This saves times for previewing the changes made to your source code by just making the changes in the VS code and saving the file. This will automatically refresh the browser and reflect the changes you have made in it, instead of us manually refreshing the browser page.</p>
    <p class="heading">Beautify:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for formatting files like HTML. The unformatted code in these files is converted into formatted, readable code by this extension. You can set this setting in the VS Code preferences, which will then automatically format all the code you have typed in the editor. </p>
    <p class="heading">Better Comments:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for differentiating comment types like warnings, errors, highlights, and queries to improve the readability and understandability of the code.</p>
    <p class="heading">Better Alig:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for aligning the code. It can be used to align multiple variable declarations, trailing comments, sections of code, and more.</p>
    <p class="heading">Polacode:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for taking code snippet screenshots. It can be used to copy and paste the code you need in snippet screenshots easily and save them after installing the extension.</p>
    <p class="heading">Settings Sync:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for saving your settings in the editor to restore them in a new machine, instead of configuring them each time. This can be useful in setting up a customized development environment in the editors. Using this extension, we can upload the settings in a GitHub location and then restore them to a new machine for the editors.</p>
    <p class="heading">JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippets:</p>
    <p class="paragraph">This extension is used for setting shortcut triggers for JavaScript code that can be used to invoke a full code instead of typing out code on each instance. This will be useful while working on projects with a large amount of codes.</p>
