                When we think of our well-being, how often do we direct our focus to mental health? ‘Mental health’ is synonymous to ‘Voldemort’: both terms have stigma attached that prevents people from speaking about them. However, with our ambassador program, we aim to turn the tide.
                Powered by the young.!
                The ambassador program is made by the Young, for the Young. Young people are powered by energy to make the world better, however, they are put in combat with stereotypes of judging every time they try doing something epic. We invite you to take an active stance for Mental Heath.</small><br>
