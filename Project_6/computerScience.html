      <p>Web developers build websites. A graphic designer gives the design to the web developer, who then turns that into code that computers and various devices can read. Images and videos also get turned into code by a web developer for various devices to understand. Before building the website it is important for the web developer to understand the needs of the client and the target audience as well. Along with the interface and user experience specialist, they work together to ensure that the flow of the website makes sense for the needs of the client.</p>
