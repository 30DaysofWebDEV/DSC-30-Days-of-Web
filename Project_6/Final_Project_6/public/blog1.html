            alt="Web Development">
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Hi Readers. Today anyone can learn anything whether it is a new technical thing that is
            trending or any other
            technical stuff that could be a Programming Language. Basically we are going to see the use of JAVASCRIPT.
            Here
            You will see the blog on perfect combination of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) along with the taste the
            JAVASCRIPT
            provides at the Frontend And Backend Both in web development. Here I will focus mainly at the Frontend part
            consisting of Vanilla JAVASCRIPT along with the use of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) which designs the website
            in
            a very comprehensive way. We will also take look at various animations and transition that are playing big
            role
            in the UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) improvement. At the you all can find the necessary resources
            required for comprehensive and stylish Front End Web Development.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up-right">Web Development Is one of the rising passions in this technical world. In every
            passionate web development
            learner, the ultimate goal is to design a webpage or a webpage with a lot of designs and functionalities.
            This seems very superior to think inside our mind, but the question arises “How to design a website with
            full of
            interaction ?”
            Every website or a webpage we see on a web browser is consisting of a lot of instructions and steps involved
            in
            making of that website and designing of that webpage which has been created by the use of various components
            which includes the use of libraries and framework code. In order to make a website, thinking the design of
            the
            page or how the page looks is really important as it will help us to reference about the how we have to
            design
            the webpage. It could be done with the help of Wireframes. They consist of various components hat are to be
            situated inside a webpage.
        </p>

            alt="HTML">
        <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">HTML basically provides the basic structure about the webpage or the website that is
            visible to a client or
            the
            user that is using that website for a particular use.
            Here you can see the presence of the presence of the basic HTML document which we will focus later on to the
            application of CSS and further the application of the JAVASCRIPT which will make it one of the great web
            document with a lot of animations and presence of good interaction with the components of the web document
            with
            absolute stunning UI of the webpage.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="zoom-out-down">CSS provides the basic structure of the styling to the webpage or the website that
            has been formed with he
            use
            HTML and makes to look the website look very user interactive in design and improves the user interface a
            lot.
            Now our task includes to design the webpage that we have included in it and then to add the styles to the
            UI/UX
            by using the CSS . We are here going to separately add the external CSS File which will include all of the
            styles of the CSS. Here in the CSS we will take all of the different components and then take each component
            for
            taking down the styles individually for that particular component and then take each of the component and
            then
            add styles to that webpage. CSS adds a lot of styling to a common and simple looking webpage and design it
            to
            look really impressive in scene and make it look really awesome.

            alt="Web Design">
        <p data-aos="zoom-out-left">JAVASCRIPT provides the life to the website or the webpage by making interactive in
            nature by making it user
            interactive in which the user could do calculations in it, interact with the buttons or the components of
            the
            website. After it’s release in back 1995 it has been one of the most powerful component of web development
            which
            has created a big revolution in this modern field.
            Now you all will see the nice interaction with the web documents by use of DOM. DOM refers to Document
            Object
            Model. All the elements we are talking about are the parts and various other components that can be referred
            as
            the HTML parent elements or he HTML child elements. As JAVASCRIPT is a scripting language and that all helps
            us
            to use the logic behind the scene in the client side webpage. UI/UX can also be changed in the Vanilla
            JAVASCRIPT. JAVASCRIPT changed the whole world as now we can code in JAVASCRIPT to make our Backend vey
            feasible
            and that helps a user to learn single programming language and apply that particular knowledge for making
            the
            website and resulting in the comprehensive design of the webpage.
