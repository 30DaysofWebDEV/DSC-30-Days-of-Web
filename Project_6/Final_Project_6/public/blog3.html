            alt="Web Development">
        <p data-aos="fade-left">The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing
            before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented
            integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for
            information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their
            computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful
            examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information
            infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia
            have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. The Internet Has All Along
            Changed The Web World.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-up-right">The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled
            through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his
            “Galactic Network” concept. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone
            could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet
            of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962.
            While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher
            Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.

        <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">Most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper
            mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services
            such as email, Internet telephony, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video
            streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are
            reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new
            forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services.
            Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it
            enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and
            services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains
            across entire industries.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="zoom-out-down">The World Wide Web is a global collection of documents, images, multimedia,
            applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource
            Identifiers (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services,
            web servers, databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. Web services also use HTTP for communication
            between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is
            one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet

        <p data-aos="zoom-out-left">
            Now by the use of internet, the people can connect along with other parts of world by the use of social
            media and this all helps in gaining a lot of features. Today we can find anything on internet and gain a lot
            of information by the use of internet which basically is the internetworking of the people all around the
            world. So internet has revolutionized whole world and now it seems that world is a small place to live in
            place.
