                            </h5>
                            <br>
                           
<p>Yeah, obviously this is the era of consoles. But still a large number of programmers depend on PCs to cater their gaming satisfaction.These are the ones who really like to record their gaming skills and share their gaming experience. Well, there are all sorts of games available to try out which includes FPS games, strategy, sports and lots. And the best is, when you can perform some serious tricks and actually boast about it in front of your friends!
 This can only be possible if you have a great Recording Software in your PC. Some other aspects of game recording software are they are a better option than online streaming specially when the bandwidth is disappointing and you can even edit the gameplay to trim and highlight only the needed contents.
</p>
<p>However there are tons of games recording tool available in the market both paid and free, each of which are claiming to be the best in class. Well if you are someone looking for the best Windows game recording software, you just made to the right place…</p>

<p>We have taken the pleasure to shortlist 6 top-rated Game Recording Software for Windows currently available that provide efficient performances.</p>
<p><h3><u>1.  Open Broadcaster Software</u></h3></p>
   
<p>OBS(Open Broadcast Software) is free and compatible with Windows. It's probably the best tool in this category because of its open-source and flexible nature which means that the online community can fix any bugs whenever they want and continually optimize it and reduce real time issues.
OBS has the option of recording both MP4 and FLV formats using the PC’s GPU to enhance the recording quality with a ratio of 1:1.</p>   
     
<p>In OBS, you can also opt for dual monitor setup to adjust the recording and more interestingly there are plugin to enhance functionality. The software studio also features custom transitions to seamlessly switch between numerous scenes along with pre-source filter aided audio mixer.
However, the not-so-user-friendly ‘Dock’ UI makes it lag a bit.</p>

<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7.</p>

<p><h3><u>2. Bandicam</u></h3></p>

<p>Bandicam Screen Recorder is one of the most well-known screen recording software for Windows.It records at high bitrates and frame rates with an option of 2D, 3D and 4K Ultra HD resolution. Its built-in compression feature allows it to record small size videos without sacrificing the quality. It has an Intuitive User Interface with dual(internal and external) audio feature and includes multiple codec formats.</p>

<p>However Bandicam is not for free and unlike OBS, this comes with a trial version and eventually a price tag of $40.It does not support live streaming and sometimes lag issues can be noted.Still Bandicam is efficient enough to qualify in our list and capable of providing fulfillment to  both beginners and professional gamers.</p>

<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7</p>

<p><h3><u>3. NVIDIA SHADOWPLAY</u><p></h3>

<p>NVIDIA is well known for its gaming and so is its game recording software.
This program has been specially designed for best results when used by gamers having GeForce GPUs installed in their PCs.Shadowplay has the ability to save best quality videos even from past scenes of the game.One feature that provides the Shadowplay a head-start, is it’s ‘Instant replay feature’ which lacks in most of the recording programs.It supports free streaming without any time limit. No watermarks are included and it comes with a user-friendly interface.</p>

<p>And of course, like all other it has some cons which include less featured program and its efficiency is limited to Nvidia graphics card users only.</p>

<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7</p>

<p><h3><u>4. Action<p></h3></u>
 <p>Action is often regarded as the All-Around Recording Software.It’s the best choice for you if you want a speedy recording of your gameplay with the support of 4K and even 8K recording.It operates on a very slick UI interface with hotkeys for screenshots, recording of real-time M4A audio.Live streaming is available in the Action platform.All recorded games can be exported in different file formats.</p>

<p>However software like ‘Action’ looks good and performs good only with high end hardware and PCs. It comes with a 30 days trial with a lifetime licence for about $30.</p>  

<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7</p>

<p><h3><u>5.Dxtory<p></h3></u>
<p>Dxtory is well known for its high speed processing as it acquires all the data elements from the surface memory buffer.It’s one of the lightest software and still quite robust.It characterises a simple and yet very understandable form of its settings. Audio system is capable of recording dual audio(internal and external) that can be edited separately later. It enable the user to choose from a vast range of frame rates from 10 to 120.It’s basic UI has perks like ample customisation options and an Intuitive user experience.</p>
  
<p>Well,we can suggest this Program only for professional gamers and no recommended for casual gamers. Moreover it has the annoying trial notifications.</p>

<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7</p>

<p><h3><u>6. AMD RElive<p></h3></u>

<p>Last but not the least, AMD RElive is a game recording software that is perfectly customizable for consumers with an AMD card. It has several cool features and most importantly is completely free. It’s an integrated Recording for gamers stuffed with features like using GPU power to record gameplay, multi-channel audio, full control over hotkeys and Scene Editor.It includes several presets for audio and video.</p>
<p>In brief, AMD Radeon ReLive is AMD’s and Shadowplay are quite similar in capabilities, with the AMD a bit ahead while used in a PC with AMD GPU.</p>

<p>Although it takes some time to set up and has a learning curve but still if you are fond of customisations and an AMD user above all then this can be the best option.</p>
 
<p>Compatible with-Windows 10,8.1,8 and 7</p>
