<p class="paragraph" style="line-height:30px;">It's all started when one day, I was working on my some projects and browsing my youtube then there was a video of 30 days of web development (kick-off call) when I saw that video and I liked it because of their agendas, mentor assistance, learning skills they provide and everyone's favourite certifications.I already know about little bit of frontend skills like HTML, CSS and javascript.
  So, it sounds challenging and learn new skills also like boostrap, firebase, etc.In skillenza platform , there are various stages First is  github then HTML, CSS, Bootsrap, javascript , hosting and backend. each of these stages contains content, videos, quizzes and one project. I know it's a lot I also thought at my first day of starting this program . but the content and webinars they provide are totally awesome  and innovative.It's quite when I was doing quizzes and projects.It gives self confidence.I was feeling thrilled by seeing my name in leaderboard . Personally , I didn't know about anything in backend like level 0 and even not having any interest in it. But their webinars and contents  are so good that now i have interest in backend and doing my all projects in backend also. So, this program is totally worth it.
  the program was very good at mentor assistance, contents, quizzes, projects and much more.
  So, thank you DSC for providing such a wonderful program and I am looking forward for more such programs.
