                    Qualcomm recently took an in-depth look back at the history of the mobile phone, which it was mostly responsible for creating. This turned out to be a personal retrospect because my family owned an electronics company in the 1960s, which was when I used my first mobile phone in my father's Studebaker Avanti.
                    <br> <br>
                    At the time, I thought it was the most amazing thing to be able to make a call from a car. What was funny is that phone had a dial and buttons, which mostly didn't seem to do anything, and it worked more like a radio on a boat or plane than an actual phone. But it was cool.

                    As we advance 50 years to the present, our smartphones do more things than our PCs because they are more portable, more likely to be with us, and handle telephony.
                    <br>  <br>     
                    Cisco last week released its desktop phone replacement, the Webex Desk Hub. While this device initially only merges your desktop phone and smartphone, it could quickly evolve to replace your PC as well.
                    <br>  <br>      
                    Since we're approaching the end of 2020, let's speculate a bit about how the smartphone and the PC will likely evolve over the next three decades, and build up to what that means for personal communications technology in 2050.
                    <br>  <br>     
                    We'll close with my product of the week, the aforementioned Webex Desk Hub, which is arguably the most evolutionary innovation to the desk phone since its invention.

                    This decade takes us to where many of us believe the singularity will have primarily occurred. We'll still have pure humans that live in defined regions or off-planet fighting the change. Still, most people will be connected to their computing resources surgically and call on those services mentally to enhance performance.
                    <br><br>
                    Digital immortality becomes far more common -- though it has been available to the rich for some time at this point -- and your digital assistant can morph into friends and family (even deceased family) that you can interface with throughout your life. By this time, people who want to live in a virtual world can, and the need for human workers will be vastly reduced given that robots and AIs will be fully able to take your ideas and translate them into action.
                    <br><br>
                    Your ability to multitask will be massively enhanced. A service will primarily regulate your body, and your mental attitude will be remotely regulated. This outcome will create significant problems concerning the determination of what is human and what is a robot, given there will be a lot of variation in the depth of the blend between the two concepts. You generally won't tell or care if you are talking to a real person or an AI, and much of your interaction will now occur with digital AI proxies.
                    <br><br>
                    Here the smartphone no longer exists because communication is inherent with your embedded technology solution. This outcome will significantly broaden the divide between those that can afford and accept these technological changes and those that don't. I expect there will be many conflicts that will resolve poorly for the pure humans in this decade. In short, in the 2050s, you become the smartphone.

                    - The obsolescence of transportation: because if you can go anyplace virtually and feel like you are there, do you need to travel?
                    <br><br>
                    - Changes to the nuclear family: because I expect many will choose a virtual mate over a human, given they can be custom-built for you. Will you want to raise a child or have a permanent virtual child -- or an intelligent virtual or robotic pet that is your perfect match?
                    <br><br>
                    I expect that sometime in the 2030s PCs and phones will merge, if they hadn't already. In the 2040s people and personal technology will merge as humans and robotics evolve into hybrids of both. We'll have many political, social, and religious hurdles to overcome -- some of which are likely to result in war both inside of and between countries before reaching the 2060s.
                    <br><br>
                    This outcome could be a utopia -- or hell on Earth -- depending on how well we manage these changes, and the only sure thing is we aren't anywhere near ready for them.
