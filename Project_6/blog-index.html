                <p>Welcome to HOGWARTS !</p>
                <p class="date"> &#9679; 12/01/2021 &#9679; </p><br>
                <p>HOGWARTS - School of Witchcraft and wizardry reminds us of a famous fictional character <b>HARRY POTTER.</b>
                    But Harry is not fictional he's <b>REAL </b>.
                </p>
                 <p class="moremm">
                    Harry Potter is real. <br>
                    Ok, may be not in a wand-waving, Voldemort-defeting sense, but his experiences are all too familiar to thousands of children.
                    Living with his people who don't want him; surviving the sudden removal of his parents - Harry grew up in care. <br>
                    The outcomes for children and young people who experience care are not always positive. <br><br>
                    <b>You may think his experiences were too extreme to be real; how can a close relative treat a child so callously?</b><br><br>
                    Sadly this is the part that’s true.<b>Should we feel sorry for these children?</b> No: we should make things better for them. <br>
                    The shame of the carers about the reason for the placement, leading to a failure to tell the truth about what happened to the parents; favouritism and preferential treatment of their ‘real’ (biological) children; the stigma of being ‘that weird kid’ leading to ostracism at school; and perpetuation of the myth that these are ‘bad kids’ meriting placement at St Brutus’ School for Incurably Criminal Boys – all true. <br>
                    Ok, maybe not the name of the school, but certainly the perception or assumption that these are children under suspicion and assumed to be heading down the wrong path.<br><br>
                    The world of Harry Potter has inspired so many care experienced young people.
                    It has provided them with hope when all seemed hopeless and an opportunity to escape their reality, if only for a moment.

                 <p>Why Tony Stark is my ATF ? </p> 
                 <p class="date"> &#9679; 06/01/2021 &#9679; </p><br>
                 <p>While Batman and superman hide behind a mask, <b>Iron Man wants the world to know that Tony Stark is the man in the suit.</b> He's not the perfect character as many Super Heroes are depicted.He has his flaws like
                      the average person yet has built an empire that reflects his personality and passion for his craft. Thank You <b>Robert Downey Jr.</b> Sir , You played Tony Stark the BEST way possible.
                     </p>
                 <p class="moremm"><br>
                    Self confidence is one traight that Iron Man has that can be seen throughout every scene. His <b>self-confidence</b> is the difference between his sense of being <b>unstoppable</b> and the being scared out of your wits in the face of controversy. <br>
                    At the end of the day to be self confident <b>you have to be comfortable with who you are and who you are trying or striving to become. </b><br><br>
                    <b>What's it take to be like Tony Stark?</b> <br><br>
                    Tip #1: Talk Slower
                    Three words: Slow. It. Down. When you talk slower, you will appear to be more smooth with your conversations. <br>
                    Tip #2: Identify Your Strengths and Weaknesses
Self Awareness is not only a key to success but it’s also the key to confidence. If you don’t know what you’re bad at, you can’t truly understand what you’re actually good at. <br>
Tip #3: Control Your Reactions
A lot of people allow their emotions to get the better of them in high stake situations. Rather than making sudden and instant decisions, control your reactions and make the appropriate decisions later if necessary.  <br><br>

                 <p>The Language that will Rule in 2021 is ... !!</p>
                 <p class="date"> &#9679; 24/12/2020 &#9679; </p><br>
                 <p>The top most competetors for this are <b>PYTHON</b> and <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>. Python is ranking at the #1 position for Dec-2020 , whereas Javascript is the top most popular language among developers according to the survey conducted by <b>Stack Overflow</b>.
                     For me <b>Javascript</b> is the RULER coz i'm a developer :D
                 </p><br>
                  <p class="moremm">
                     Let's talk about both of these languages . <br><br>
                     <b>1. Javascript :</b> Many languages came and disappear but JavaScript is one of those few renowned languages that is enjoying a high run and demand in the programming world.
                     Though the language is primarily known for adding responsive elements on web pages it has a wide range of applications such as in <b> web development, game development, mobile application development, and many more</b> and the language is being used for both – <b>Front End and Back End Development.</b>
                     As there are millions of websites already existing over the web that are heavily relying on JavaScript and on top of that, looking at the demand & dominance of the language, it won’t be wrong to say that JavaScript will rule in 2021 as well! <br><br>
                     <b>2. Python :</b> As per the <b>RedMonk Ranking report</b> for the year 2020, Python outranks JAVA to become the second most popular programming language. The language has experienced tremendous growth of around <b>18-19%</b> in the last 5 years.
                     Also, the compatibility of Python with trending technologies like AI & ML makes it more preferable among the developers. <br>
                     Python has been the favorite language of almost every individual who is just starting with the programming domain for the last many years. The primary reason behind this is a quite simple syntax that makes it easy to <b>read, learn, and use.</b>
                     Several popular Python frameworks that make things more efficient & convenient are <b>Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc.</b>

                <p class="date"> &#9679; 20/12/2020 &#9679; </p><br>
                <p><b>So how many of you heard of Tesla Motors? What about SpaceX? Hyperloop? </b>
                    Yes, We are talking the <b>CEO</b> of these companies <b>ELON MUSK</b>.
                </p>
                 <p class="moremm">
                    We watched many sci-fi movies, let’s say Blade Runner, Star Wars, Total Recall and many. In all those movies they projected that the future is all about Air Transport, but this guy is digging a hole in the ground from Los Angeles to San Francisco for High-speed transportation. This time <b>I mean it literally.</b>
                    Elon Musk is the second entrepreneur in silicon valley who created three companies with a market cap of <b>$1 billion or more </b>with PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX. But do you know <b>“he got fired as a CEO from his own company”?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Now Elon Musk is the Founder of SpaceX, The Boring Company, CEO of Tesla Motors, CEO of Neuralink, Chairman of SolarCity and Co-chairman of OpenAI. From an Immigrant to Advisor of the US President. From failure to Success. Now Elon Musk Net Worth is <b>$20.6 billion.</b>
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Have you ever wondered why the best success stories mostly begin with failure??</b><br><br>
Some people say that <b>Failure is the first step to success</b>, and there is a man who invented the bulb he said this famous quote <b>“I have not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” </b> well it’s a hell of a quote, isn’t it? But do you know what I think about “why most success stories begin with failure?” Because they haven’t stopped at the failure, they keep on pushing their limits irrespective of their circumstances.
                <br>Maybe there will be a time in your life where you feel like everything is not working, your work, your relationships, everything but whenever you feel like that all you have to do is one thing, <b>“Just Keep Pushing”</b>.
