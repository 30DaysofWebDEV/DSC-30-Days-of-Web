            30 Days Of Web Development Got Started From 20 December Last Year And The Things I havve Learned From it and
            learned many new things such as firebase that was really new to me as i was used many other things such as
            node js and mongo DB as the backend and database for the web development. Here i also met various other new
            mentors and seniors which helped in helped in every issue or error i got and that has made me very efficient
            in coding and web development and the resources that could be used here and there so that could be used in
            various things.I Would like to thanks <strong>Harsh Kumar Khatri</strong> Sir for smooth conduction of the
            program. they made us learn various other thing which are really necessary along with coding.various other
            new guys and partners in coding met with me that have taught me really necessary new things that would be
            really important in upcoming life.

            the path started from html and went through styling with CSS and then it went through framework bootstrap
            and finally we went into the ocean of scripting language javascript that had given life to web development
            and finally we went into the firebase which provided various other facilities such as database, backend
            along with hosting services.
            so in last, i colud conclude that the projects that i developed in this series or the path were really
            interesting and unique projects that could be included in our CV or resume that would be really beneficial.
            I hope we get to see more path or series of interesting coding competitions from DSC Gropus all over the
            INDIA as i am also the member of DSC NIT J . it was great expereince with various Gopus and collaborators as
            it made this program really big thing that could help many of students to achieve new things in their life.
